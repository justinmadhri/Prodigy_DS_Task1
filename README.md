# Prodigy_DS_Task1
Problem Statements :- Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. 

# Data Set
The dataset used for this task is [worldpopulationdata.csv](https://github.com/justinmadhri/Prodigy_DS_Task1/blob/a6dc750c72e5c2f7a881db0a30677856aac4a55a/worldpopulationdata.csv) . This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022.

# Key skills include:

1. Data Cleaning: Identifying and resolving missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to maintain accurate datasets.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gained proficiency in using visual tools such as bar charts and histograms to analyze data distributions, trends, and patterns.

Through Task 1, you improved my ability to create visualizations that make it easier to understand datasets, particularly in areas like population demographics, helping to extract valuable insights quickly.
